## Niko Commission
Commissioned by my friend [Aran](https://twitter.com/aranarts), who owns this character.

Niko is an exorcist priest so I wanted to illustrate him exploring a haunting. I wanted this composition to be workable as a stream stinger so I opted for a close-up of Niko in the dark. This way it can be set somewhere to incorporate text on top of the dark fill seamlessly.
